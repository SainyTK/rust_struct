# Rust Struct Concept Tutorial
## Introduction
Structs are super handy for creating custom data types and organizing related data. By the end of this, you’ll know how to define, use, and manipulate structs in Rust.

## Key Highlights
	1.	Defining Structs: Learn how to create structs with named fields.
	2.	Instantiating Structs: See how to make instances of your structs.
	3.	Accessing Fields: Find out how to get and set struct fields.
	4.	Method Implementation: Add methods to your structs for extra functionality.
	5.	Tuple Structs: Check out tuple structs and when to use them.
	6.	Unit-like Structs: Understand unit-like structs and their use cases.
	7.	Struct Update Syntax: Use the struct update syntax for creating new instances easily.

## How to run the code
To run the examples, you’ll need Rust installed. If you haven’t done that yet, head over to the official Rust website and follow the instructions.
Here’s how you can run the code:

1.	Clone the Repository: If this tutorial is in a Git repo, clone it:
```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
```

2.	Navigate to the Project Directory: Go to the directory with the code:
```
    cd path/to/tutorial
```

3.	Compile and Run: Use ⁠rustc to compile and run, or use Cargo if it’s a Cargo project:
```
    cargo build
    cargo run
```
